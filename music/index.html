        <h3>Experience, Versatility and Sensitivity</h2>
        <p>Whether you're planning a wedding, funeral, or other significant occasion, I offer tailored musical services designed to honour the emotional and ceremonial weight of the moment. I work closely with clients to understand their preferences and the unique context of their event — whether that means crafting a custom arrangement, navigating liturgical requirements with care, or assembling a trusted ensemble to bring your vision to life. With a foundation in both technical excellence and pastoral sensitivity, I aim to make the music not just beautiful, but truly fitting.</p>
        <p>From a childhood steeped in ensemble music and formal training across piano, recorder, and violin, to a career spanning liturgical leadership, music theatre, and bespoke event performance, I bring a breadth of experience and a deep sensitivity to the role music plays in meaningful moments. My work has taken me from parish choirs and diocesan events to international touring productions, and I’ve served as a vocalist, instrumentalist, arranger, director, and educator across a wide range of styles — including sacred music (traditional and contemporary), jazz, theatre, and popular music.</p>
